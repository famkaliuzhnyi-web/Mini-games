# ⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe - Game Design Document

## Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a classic strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces with their symbol (X or O), aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Grid Layout**: 3×3 playing field with 9 cells
- **Turn System**: Players alternate placing their symbols
- **Symbol Placement**: Click/tap empty cells to place X or O
- **Victory Conditions**: Three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- **Draw Condition**: All cells filled without a winner

### Player Symbols
- **Player 1**: X (traditionally goes first)
- **Player 2**: O (responds to X's moves)
- **Visual Design**: Clear, distinct symbols with optional themes
- **Animation**: Smooth symbol placement and highlighting

### Game Flow
1. **Game Start**: Empty 3×3 grid displayed
2. **Turn Indication**: Clear visual cue showing current player
3. **Move Selection**: Player clicks available cell
4. **Symbol Placement**: Immediate visual feedback
5. **Win/Draw Check**: Automatic detection after each move
6. **Game End**: Victory celebration or draw announcement
7. **New Game**: Option to play again immediately

## Algorithm Details

### Win Detection
```typescript
function checkWinner(board: string[][]): string | null {
  // Check rows
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (board[i][0] && board[i][0] === board[i][1] && board[i][1] === board[i][2]) {
      return board[i][0];
    }
  }
  
  // Check columns
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (board[0][j] && board[0][j] === board[1][j] && board[1][j] === board[2][j]) {
      return board[0][j];
    }
  }
  
  // Check diagonals
  if (board[0][0] && board[0][0] === board[1][1] && board[1][1] === board[2][2]) {
    return board[0][0];
  }
  if (board[0][2] && board[0][2] === board[1][1] && board[1][1] === board[2][0]) {
    return board[0][2];
  }
  
  return null; // No winner
}
```

```typescript
function minimax(board: string[][], isMaximizing: boolean, depth: number): number {
  const winner = checkWinner(board);
  
  if (winner === 'X') return -10 + depth;
  if (winner === 'O') return 10 - depth;
  if (isBoardFull(board)) return 0;
  
  if (isMaximizing) {
    let bestScore = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (board[i][j] === '') {
          board[i][j] = 'O';
          const score = minimax(board, false, depth + 1);
          board[i][j] = '';
          bestScore = Math.max(score, bestScore);
        }
      }
    }
    return bestScore;
  } else {
    let bestScore = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (board[i][j] === '') {
          board[i][j] = 'X';
          const score = minimax(board, true, depth + 1);
          board[i][j] = '';
          bestScore = Math.min(score, bestScore);
        }
      }
    }
    return bestScore;
  }
