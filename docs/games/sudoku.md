# ðŸ”¢ Sudoku - Game Design Document

## Overview
Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle game. Players fill a 9Ã—9 grid with digits 1-9 so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Rules
- **Grid Structure**: 9Ã—9 grid divided into nine 3Ã—3 subgrids (boxes)
- **Number Placement**: Fill cells with digits 1-9
- **Unique Constraints**: Each row, column, and box must contain each digit exactly once
- **Given Clues**: Pre-filled numbers provide starting constraints
- **Solution Uniqueness**: Every valid Sudoku puzzle has exactly one solution

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Puzzle Generation**: Algorithm creates valid puzzle with appropriate difficulty
2. **Number Entry**: Click cell and enter digit, or use number pad
3. **Validation**: Real-time conflict detection and highlighting
4. **Notes System**: Track possible numbers in each cell
5. **Hint System**: Strategic assistance when player is stuck
6. **Completion**: Automatic victory detection when all cells are correctly filled

### Difficulty Levels
