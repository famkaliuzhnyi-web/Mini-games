# ðŸ”¢ 2048 - Game Design Document

## Overview
2048 is a sliding number puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile. Players slide tiles on a grid, and matching numbers merge to create higher values.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Grid Movement**: Slide all tiles in one direction (up, down, left, right)
- **Tile Merging**: Two tiles with same number combine into one tile with double value
- **New Tile Generation**: Random tile (2 or 4) appears after each move
- **Victory Condition**: Create a tile with the number 2048
- **Game Over**: No valid moves available (grid full and no merges possible)

### Tile Values Progression
```
2 â†’ 4 â†’ 8 â†’ 16 â†’ 32 â†’ 64 â†’ 128 â†’ 256 â†’ 512 â†’ 1024 â†’ 2048 â†’ 4096 â†’ 8192 â†’ ...
```

### Scoring System
- **Merge Points**: Equal to the value of the newly created tile
- **Bonus Multipliers**: Consecutive merges in single move
- **High Score**: Track personal best across all games
- **Move Efficiency**: Bonus for reaching 2048 in fewer moves

## Features

## Algorithm Details

### Grid Movement Logic
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for tile movement
function moveLeft(grid: number[][]): boolean {
  let moved = false;
  for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
    const compressed = compress(grid[row]);
    const merged = merge(compressed);
    const final = compress(merged);
    if (!arraysEqual(grid[row], final)) {
      grid[row] = final;
      moved = true;
    }
  }
  return moved;
}
```

### Merge Detection
- **Single Pass**: Merge tiles from movement direction
- **Merge Limit**: Each tile can only merge once per move
- **Score Calculation**: Sum all merge values
- **Animation Tracking**: Record merge positions for effects

### Random Tile Generation
- **Probability**: 90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4
- **Position Selection**: Random empty cell selection
- **Weighted Random**: Consider strategic placement options
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust probabilities based on progress
