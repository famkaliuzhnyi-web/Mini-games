# ðŸ”´ Connect Four - Game Design Document

## Overview
Connect Four is a classic strategy game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Grid Structure**: 7 columns Ã— 6 rows vertical playing field
- **Turn-Based**: Players alternate dropping discs
- **Gravity Rules**: Discs fall to the lowest available position in chosen column
- **Victory Condition**: Connect four discs in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- **Draw Condition**: Grid fills completely without a winner

### Player Actions
- **Column Selection**: Choose which column to drop disc
- **Disc Drop**: Piece falls due to gravity physics
- **Strategic Planning**: Think ahead to block opponent or create winning combinations
- **Time Management**: Optional turn timers for competitive play

### Winning Patterns
- **Horizontal**: Four consecutive discs in same row
- **Vertical**: Four consecutive discs in same column  
- **Diagonal**: Four consecutive discs in ascending or descending diagonal
- **Multiple Threats**: Create multiple winning opportunities simultaneously
