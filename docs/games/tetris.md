# ðŸ§± Tetris - Game Design Document

## Overview
Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling geometric shapes called tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player scores points. The game becomes progressively faster and more challenging.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Seven different shaped pieces fall from top
- **Line Clearing**: Complete horizontal lines disappear
- **Gravity Physics**: Pieces fall at regular intervals
- **Rotation & Movement**: Rotate and move pieces before they lock
- **Progressive Speed**: Game gradually accelerates over time

### Tetromino Pieces
- **I-piece**: Straight line (4 blocks)
- **O-piece**: Square (2Ã—2 blocks)
- **T-piece**: T-shape (3 blocks with center top)
- **S-piece**: Zigzag right (4 blocks)
- **Z-piece**: Zigzag left (4 blocks)
- **J-piece**: L-shape left (4 blocks)
- **L-piece**: L-shape right (4 blocks)

### Controls
- **Movement**: Left/Right arrow keys or A/D
- **Rotation**: Up arrow or W key (clockwise)
- **Soft Drop**: Down arrow or S key (faster fall)
- **Hard Drop**: Space bar (instant placement)
- **Hold**: C key (save current piece for later)

### Scoring System
- **Single Line**: 100 Ã— level points
- **Double Lines**: 300 Ã— level points
- **Triple Lines**: 500 Ã— level points
- **Tetris (4 lines)**: 800 Ã— level points
- **T-Spin Bonus**: Additional points for advanced technique
- **Soft Drop**: 1 point per cell dropped
- **Hard Drop**: 2 points per cell dropped

## Algorithm Details

### Piece Rotation System (SRS)
```typescript
interface RotationData {
  states: Position[][];
  wallKicks: Position[][];
}

class TetrominoRotation {
  rotate(piece: Tetromino, direction: 'clockwise' | 'counterclockwise'): boolean {
    const newState = this.getRotatedState(piece, direction);
    
    // Try basic rotation first
    if (this.isValidPosition(newState)) {
      piece.setState(newState);
      return true;
    }
    
    // Try wall kicks
    const kicks = this.getWallKicks(piece.type, piece.rotation, direction);
    for (const kick of kicks) {
      const kickedState = this.applyKick(newState, kick);
      if (this.isValidPosition(kickedState)) {
        piece.setState(kickedState);
        return true;
      }
    }
    
    return false; // Rotation failed
  }
}
```

### Line Clear Detection
```typescript
class GameMatrix {
  checkLines(): number[] {
    const completedLines: number[] = [];
    
    for (let row = 0; row < this.height; row++) {
      let isComplete = true;
      for (let col = 0; col < this.width; col++) {
        if (this.matrix[row][col] === 0) {
          isComplete = false;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (isComplete) {
        completedLines.push(row);
      }
    }
    
    return completedLines;
  }
  
  clearLines(lines: number[]): void {
    // Remove completed lines from bottom to top
    for (let i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      this.matrix.splice(lines[i], 1);
      this.matrix.unshift(new Array(this.width).fill(0));
    }
  }
}
```

### Random Piece Generation (7-Bag)
```typescript
class PieceGenerator {
  private bag: TetrominoType[] = [];
  
  getNextPiece(): TetrominoType {
    if (this.bag.length === 0) {
      this.fillBag();
    }
    
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.bag.length);
    const piece = this.bag[randomIndex];
    this.bag.splice(randomIndex, 1);
    
    return piece;
  }
  
  private fillBag(): void {
    this.bag = ['I', 'O', 'T', 'S', 'Z', 'J', 'L'];
  }
}
```
