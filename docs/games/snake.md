# üêç Snake - Game Design Document

## Overview
Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a growing snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. The snake grows longer with each food item consumed, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Snake Movement**: Continuous movement in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- **Food Consumption**: Snake grows by one segment when eating food
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends if snake hits walls or itself
- **Speed Increase**: Game gradually speeds up or player can boost speed
- **Score System**: Points earned for each food item consumed

### Controls
- **Desktop**: Arrow keys, WASD, or custom key bindings
- **Mobile**: Swipe gestures or virtual D-pad
- **Alternative**: Click/tap to change direction
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard-only navigation support

### Victory & Game Over Conditions
- **High Score**: Beat personal or global records
- **Survival Time**: Last as long as possible
- **Length Goal**: Reach specific snake length targets
- **Game Over**: Collision with walls or self
