- **Ball Physics**: Realistic ball movement with physics simulation
- **Scoring System**: First player to reach target score wins
- **Rally Mechanics**: Continuous back-and-forth ball exchanges
- **Speed Progression**: Ball gradually increases speed during rallies

### Controls
- **Player 1**: W/S keys or Up/Down arrows
- **Player 2**: Up/Down arrow keys or I/K keys
- **Mobile**: Touch and drag paddles vertically
- **AI Mode**: Computer controls one paddle automatically

### Physics System

### Ball Physics
```typescript
class Ball {
  position: Vector2;
  velocity: Vector2;
  speed: number;
  
  update(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update position based on velocity
    this.position.x += this.velocity.x * deltaTime;
    this.position.y += this.velocity.y * deltaTime;
    
    // Handle wall bounces
    if (this.position.y <= 0 || this.position.y >= courtHeight) {
      this.velocity.y *= -1;
      this.playBounceSound();
    }
    
    // Check scoring zones
    if (this.position.x <= 0) {
      this.scorePoint('player2');
    } else if (this.position.x >= courtWidth) {
      this.scorePoint('player1');
    }
  }
  
  handlePaddleCollision(paddle: Paddle): void {
    // Calculate hit position relative to paddle center
    const hitPosition = (this.position.y - paddle.center.y) / (paddle.height / 2);
    
    // Adjust ball angle based on hit position
    const maxAngle = Math.PI / 3; // 60 degrees max
    const angle = hitPosition * maxAngle;
    
    // Apply new velocity
    this.velocity.x *= -1; // Reverse horizontal direction
    this.velocity.y = Math.sin(angle) * this.speed;
    
    // Increase speed slightly
    this.speed *= 1.02;
  }
}

    // Predict ball position when it reaches paddle
    const timeToReach = Math.abs(ball.position.x - paddle.position.x) / Math.abs(ball.velocity.x);
    const predictedY = ball.position.y + (ball.velocity.y * timeToReach);
    
    // Add difficulty-based error
    const error = (Math.random() - 0.5) * (1 - this.accuracy) * paddle.height;
    const targetY = predictedY + error;
    
    // Calculate desired paddle movement
